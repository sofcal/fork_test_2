ensure you change the name for the module (in package.json) to follow the new naming schema specified by Diego

Because we're using modules hosted on myget, you'll need to register with npm your user account for that repos:

npm adduser --registry=https://sage.myget.org/F/npm/npm/

This module itself is marked as ("private": true) in the package.json, so it won't be published anywhere, make sure you
keep it in your source control. Probably worth tidying up this README too :)

Install Modules: npm install
Run: npm run start

If you start the module without changing the ARN, you'll get a whole bunch of errors logging out. Similarly if you don't have
clamav installed locally. But it should let you see the gyst

The cfn.template provided in scripts is NOT valid - this is deliberate to
    a) allow documentation; and
    b) ensure we don't deploy something that won't work
